🌍 Global COVID-19 Dashboard - Power BI Project
This Power BI project offers a dynamic and insightful visualization of the global COVID-19 pandemic, capturing country-wise and continent-wise trends across multiple dimensions. The dashboard is designed to help users analyze how the pandemic evolved globally, track key metrics, and make comparative assessments between different regions.

📊 Features & Insights
Dataset:
The data includes comprehensive COVID-19 statistics from countries around the world, including:

Daily and cumulative case numbers

Death counts

Recovery figures

Vaccination data

Testing rates

Population impact

Country and continent (Mahadeep) classification

Data Preparation:
Data cleaning and transformation were conducted in Power Query, involving:

Handling missing or inconsistent data

Standardizing country and continent names

Date formatting

Creating calculated fields for better insights (e.g., Case Fatality Rate, Vaccination %)

📌 Key Metrics Tracked
Total and daily confirmed cases and deaths

Recovery and vaccination rates

Top 10 countries by total cases and deaths

Continents with highest case densities

Case fatality and recovery rate comparisons
